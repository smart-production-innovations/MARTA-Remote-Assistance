# MARTA-Remote-Assistance

MARTA (Mixed reAlity RemoTe Assistance) is a mixed reality supported remote assistance application for PC and smartphone/tablet. Our solution connects a portable device of an on-site worker with an remote expert using a desktop application. The on-site worker starts the call by sharing a unique connection key with the remote expert, e.g. by e-mail. The remote expert uses this key to establish the connection with the on-site worker. Remote experts and on-site workers see a live video recorded by the device of the on-site worker and can extend this live video with AR annotations in 3D space to facilitate communication with visual labels

By default, the code "FHOÃ–" is used to establish a connection between a client and a server. For productive use, however, unique keys must be sent. To do this, a value must be changed on the smartphone. Connect the smartphone to the PC. Open this file:

And change the third last line to:
<GenerateUniqueKey>True</GenerateUniqueKey>
